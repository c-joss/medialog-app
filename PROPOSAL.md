# Phase 5 Project Proposal — **MediaLog: Personal Collection Tracker**

## 1. Introduction

**Overview:**  
MediaLog is a full-stack web application that allows users to organize and manage their personal collections — such as books, movies, games, or music — in one elegant interface.

**Problem:**  
People who enjoy tracking collections often rely on spreadsheets or simple note-taking apps, which don’t provide visual appeal, categorization, or efficient data management. These methods make it difficult to browse, rearrange, or share collections easily.

**Proposed Solution:**  
MediaLog replaces the need for scattered manual tracking systems with a sleek, interactive platform. Users can create collection entries, assign categories and tags, add reviews and personal ratings, visually rearrange their gallery using drag-and-drop, and export the entire collection to Excel for backup or sharing.

**Benefits:**

- **Centralized Collection Management:** Keeps all hobbies in one place with images, ratings, and categories.
- **Enhanced User Interaction:** Allows drag-and-drop reordering and Excel exporting for advanced usability.
- **Visual Appeal:** Offers a clean, professional interface with smooth animations for a modern user experience.
